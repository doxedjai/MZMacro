# MZMacro

You can create or record multiple macros and assign them to any key combinations to trigger and loop them when you need how you need.

MZ is made for gamers but it's capable of so much more. So you can use it for daily tasks as well.

For any question, bug report or feature request feel free to visit forum tab.

Note: To simulate arrow keys you might need to turn off NumLock.
