# MZMacro
MZ is a gaming macro that lets you have a macro mouse and keyboard functionally with ordinary one.

You can create or record multiple macros and assign them to any key combinations to trigger and loop them when you need how you need.

MZ is made for gamers but it's capable of so much more. So you can use it for daily tasks as well.

Note: To simulate arrow keys you might need to turn off NumLock.
